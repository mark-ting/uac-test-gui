#UAC Test#
UAC Test (uac-test-gui) is a simple, no-frills* GUI utility to test DPS for Ultra Autocannons (UACs) in PGI's MechWarrior Online. This is the more user-friendly version of the [command-line version of uac-test](https://github.com/mat3049/uac-test).

*I wish it could make you a sandwich, but `sudo` err, I mean `Run as administrator` can only do so much.

##System Requirements##
* Windows 7 or later (64-bit only for now, sorry!)
* (Optional) Dedication to SCIENCE!

##Additional Notes##
This project is only meant to be (yet) another fun exercise in code (and slightly less useful for proving theorycrafting shenanigans than its command-line counterpart).

##Project Dependencies##
Project environment:

* Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition
* Qt 5.6 msvc2015_64
